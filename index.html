<h2>
  Why am I taking this course?
</h2>
I believe it is a necessary skill to learn especially in this day and age, to be able to build good websites efficiently.
<br>
<h2>
  My goals
</h2>
My goal in this course is to learn how to efficiently build a website using html, css, and javascript. I want to learn enough to be able to provide input to a friend whose business revolves around making websites.
<h2>
  Learn Computing
</h2>
I was not in class at this time to be able to present and do a lesson. I apologize.
<h2>
  Projects I'm interested in
</h2>
<ul>
  <li>I though that <a href="https://ilovechrisbaker.com/troll-the-nsa/" target="_blank"> Troll the NSA</a>
     was interesting because of the manner that it was created. I value comedy and the random pop ups and airy theme made me laugh.</li>
  <li>I though that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/01/21/opinion/privacy-chicken-game.html" target="_blank"> Privacy
  Chicken</a> was interesting because of the information that it holds. I'm really big on privacy and understanding what big tech companies know about us, and this website did a good job of going in depth. The game format
of the website was also well thought of.</li>
  <li>I though that <a href="https://www.exhaustingacrowd.com/gwangju" target="_blank"> Exhausting a Crowd</a>
     was cool as well. I think it's cool to have real time surveillance while allowing real people to come together and
   explain different aspects of the environment</li>
